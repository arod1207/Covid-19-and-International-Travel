# I'll Take A Corona, Hold The Corona

## Description
### As the national pandemic continues, and people are isolated in their homes, they ponder, daydream about the trip that lies (hopefully) around the corner. However, we are not a typical website for simply just travel;instead, I'll Take A Corona, Hold The Corona, informs the audience on the number of cases with coronavirus in their chosen destination (by country), while simultaneously providing flight prices. Who doesn't like a good caveat before shelling out money to get from here to there? Just to reiterate, the user will simply utilize a search form to investigate flight destination, date of travel, as well as view the current time in their preferred embarkment, all while using sound judgment, and being in the know of what locations have the highest, lowest, and median volume of coronavirus. The numbers will be populated in realtime using APIs and displayed on the website.
